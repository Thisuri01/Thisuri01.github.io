I'm Thisuri Jayarathne, a final-year undergraduate student specializing in Statistics at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka. I am passionate about data science, statistical modeling, and uncovering insights that can drive smarter decisions. With hands-on experience in data analysis, R, and Python, I enjoy transforming complex data into meaningful narratives.

Beyond academics, I actively contribute as a writer for the Rotaract Club, where I merge creativity with communication to promote impactful ideas. My interests span from Time Series Analysis to Machine Learning, and I aspire to work in roles that combine research, analytics, and real-world applications of statistics.
